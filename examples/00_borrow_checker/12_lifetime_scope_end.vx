// Phase 4: Lifetime Analysis - Reference outlives referent (should pass for now)
// This test demonstrates that Phase 4 currently only checks return statements
// Full flow-sensitive analysis would catch this, but is not yet implemented

fn main(): i32 {
    let temp = 0;
    let ref_val = &temp;  // OK: temp lives for whole function
    return 0;
}
